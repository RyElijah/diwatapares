                        <p class="lead">Fortune General Insurance Corporation is an insurance company that focuses on providing non-life insurance to Filipinos for more than half a century. However, despite being in the industry for many years, FGEN Insurance Corporation still caters to their clients in a traditional setup where clients apply for insurance manually rather than digitally. Therefore, our group aims to provide the company with a database design suite to enable them to offer digital insurance applications for their clients. </p>
